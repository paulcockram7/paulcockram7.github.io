## Multimedia Presentation mini project
 
**Scenario**

- You have been employed to assist in the organisation and promotion of a live charity music concert to be held at your school for all the students who currently attend Archway Academy.
- The bands and artists performing at the concert have agreed to provide their services free of charge so that more money can be raised for a chosen charity. You must decide on the bands and artists who will play at the concert. The date, timing, ticket prices, ordering details and other features (e.g. digital images; clipart; animations etc.) will also need to be decided so that these can be included in the interactive multimedia product you will design and produce.
- Your presentation must have a suitable housestyle that uses the charity you have chosen as a basis for this.
- You must design and produce a multimedia product in the form of an interactive multimedia presentation that could be viewed on a standalone touch screen in a foyer. It must be designed to allow the user to interact with the product so that they can find the information that interests them or that they need to know. 
- Your presentation needs to persuade the students of Archway Academy to purchase a ticket for the charity concert. You need to raise as much money as possible for your chosen charity.
